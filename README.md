# Diktionary
A Simple Android Dictionary App! Check word meanings, synonyms, antonyms, examples, and 
pronounciations!

The dictionary app is very basic and its UI design is simple and minimal. The app does not 
sport any design patterns or special features, but was created solely for educational purposes.

All changes/future improvements on the app will be pushed to Git, as well as release notes of 
some kind detailing changes made, bugs detected/things to be worked on. I hope to also show 
comparisons of perfomances between basic and improved versions.

In case you get to use the app code, you can do well to lemme know how you have improved on the
dictionary app, or any feedback or suggestion will be appreciated.

Cheers. :)
